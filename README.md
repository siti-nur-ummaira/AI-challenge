# National AI Student Challenge 2023
We are Siti, Tanya and Qinghe from NTU, participating in Category B.

In this repository, you will find our code and resoruces used for the challenge.

Face shape dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niten19/face-shape-dataset

Our model can be added as a custom node in the Peeking Duck pipeline, and used to classify user's faces into five categories - heart, oblong, oval, round and square.

We tried using two CNN models - the first one was our own and the second one was Resnet34. We have observed that both these models do not have good accuracy. Our steps to improve accuracy would be to try different model architectures. We could also create another dataset with more well-defined images, or add more face shape classes so that each class can be easily identified.
