# National AI Student Challenge 2023
We are Siti, Tanya and Qinghe from NTU, participating in Category B.

In this repository, you will find our code and resoruces used for the challenge.

Face shape dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niten19/face-shape-dataset

Our model has been trained using Resnet34, which is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of extracting features from image data. This model can be added as a custom node in the Peeking Duck pipeline, and used to classify user's faces into five categories - heart, oblong, oval, round and square.
